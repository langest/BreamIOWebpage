  <p class="newscontent">Bream IO at DreamHack Summer 2014!
    The Bream IO team is once again at DreamHack bringing eye-tracking experience to professional e-sports. This time we will be working on the CS:GO tournament and will be tracking 2 whole teams (10 players) simultaneously. We are currently working on the finishing touches and are very exited to bring a new dimension to DreamHack spectators.
