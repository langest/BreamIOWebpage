		Hello everyone!<br>
		As we finally have got our website up and running I though I would post a litte demo of how the development of out product is going.<br>
		Now we can easily set up eye-tracking to enhance the viewers experience in twitch broadcasts. Here is a video of me showing it off. :D
	<br>
	What do you guys think of this? If you have any feedback we would love to hear from you in <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/22zvez/hearthstone_with_eye_tracking/" target="_blank"> this</a> reddit post.
